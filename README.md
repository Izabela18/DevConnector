# DevConnector
Backend for social network for developers with api routes in MongoDB.
The backbone for an app that creates forum for developers: first by registering, then creating a portfolio description and adding new posts.
Authentication of users is based on 'jsonwebtoken' and 'bcryptjs' for registration and login.
Data is handled with Mongoose and its Schemas. GET/POST/PUT/DELETE requests to different routes are sent by Postman.
